"Chatton, et al.","G-computation, propensity score-based methods, and targeted maximum likelihood estimator for causal inference with different covariates sets: a comparative simulation study",2020,"Article compares different semi-parametic approaches, including tmle and matching, but finds G-comp performs relatively best.  Given their simulation, the was predictable because they simulated from a parametric model and used the same model for estimating the regression, thus showing the superiority of maximum likelihood estimation in parametric models.  Thus, not a realistic setting.",Con
